# logistic-regression-with-lasso-adaptive-lasso-and-group-lasso-for-predicting-credit-card-default

This is the R code for the statistics learning project. 

As the credit risk is increasingly crucial in the financial industry, credit card default prediction is necessary for both financial institutions and customers. With the large
number of economic indicators, it is important to understand how to develop a reliable and interpretable model with appropriate variable selection. In this project, we explore 
lasso and its variants, group lasso, adaptive lasso and adaptive group lasso combined with logistic regression to predict the credit card default in Taiwan, and evaluate 
prediction performance with AUC due to the imbalance characteristic of the data set. We find that lasso generally increasing the AUC performance, especially in decreasing 
the variability; and among all variants, adaptive group lasso performs the best.
